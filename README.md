# Handling-Imbalance-data
This repository will compare the performance of different classification algorithms on various imbalanced datasets using multiple balancing techniques.
## Classification Algorithms: 
- Logistic Rgression
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
## Balancing Techniques
- SMOTE: We balanced the data in two ways a) Whole data b) Train data only 
- ADASYN same as in SMOTE
- UNDER SAMPLING same as in SMOTE
- ALGORITHMIC WEIGHTAGE
- GAN same as in SMOTE
## Datasets
- Fraud
- Churn
- BankMarketing
